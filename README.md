# Brightness Slider and NoSleep
If you have a MacBook4,1, you might notice two little applications have been installed along with macOS Patcher's other patches. They help solve specific issues on the MacBook4,1 and should be opened and configured after patching. NoSleep is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/integralpro/nosleep). Brightness Slider is made by ACT Productions and can be found on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brightness-control/id456624497?ls=1&mt=12).

# Catalina software update patch
When installing software updates on macOS 10.15 Catalina, you'll have to hold the option key when your Mac first reboots and select your system drive. Once booted, your Mac should automatically patch the update and reboot after a few seconds. The update will then install normally. It's highly recommended to have a patched installer to patch your system after the update.
